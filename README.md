# DeepCool Digital Dart

> **This is a fork** of
> [RahnRazamai/deepcool_digital_dart](https://github.com/RahnRazamai/deepcool_digital_dart)
> with Windows fixes. Upstream only accepts pull requests from collaborators,
> so the changes live here until they can be merged upstream.
>
> Changes in this fork (October 2026):
>
> - Sensor backend no longer crashes on startup (CI bundled the .NET 10
>   LibreHardwareMonitor build instead of the .NET Framework one).
> - `hidapi.dll` is now included in Windows packages, so the app can send data
>   to the display.
> - The installer bundles and silently installs the PawnIO driver, needed for
>   CPU temperature, power and fan sensors.
> - CPU frequency shows the real core clock instead of the effective clock.
> - CPU fan RPM is read from the motherboard Super I/O chip.
> - The sensor backend only polls CPU, GPU, motherboard and PSU, so it no
>   longer wakes sleeping hard drives.
>
> These fixes have been tested on Windows PCs but **not on real DeepCool
> hardware**. Download the Windows installer from this fork's
> [releases](https://github.com/tomwright0/deepcool_digital_dart/releases).

Desktop app for DeepCool Digital displays. Linux is the most complete target;
Windows support is available for HID display updates with limited telemetry.

Supported models:

- Air coolers: **AG300 DIGITAL**, **AG400 DIGITAL**, **AG500 DIGITAL**,
  **AG620 DIGITAL**, **AK400 DIGITAL**, **AK400 DIGITAL PRO**,
  **AK400 G2 DIGITAL NYX**, **AK500 DIGITAL**, **AK500 DIGITAL PRO**,
  **AK500 G2 DIGITAL NYX**, **AK500S DIGITAL**, **AK620 DIGITAL**,
  **AK620 DIGITAL PRO**, **AK620 G2 DIGITAL NYX**,
  **AK700 DIGITAL NYX**, **ASSASSIN IV VC VISION**
- Liquid coolers: **LD240**, **LD360**, **LP240**, **LP360**, **LQ240**,
  **LQ360**, **LS520 SE DIGITAL**, **LS720 SE DIGITAL**
- Cases: **CH170 DIGITAL**, **CH270 DIGITAL**, **CH360 DIGITAL**,
  **CH510 MESH DIGITAL**, **CH560 DIGITAL**, **CH690 DIGITAL**,
  **MORPHEUS**

Use it to choose what the display shows: CPU, GPU, or PSU mode. After you save
a mode, the app can keep the display running in the background, even after you
close the window.

Some devices only support CPU display modes. The app auto-detects the connected
model and uses the right packet format for that hardware.

This is an unofficial GPLv3 Dart port of
[`deepcool-digital-linux`](https://github.com/Nortank12/deepcool-digital-linux).

## Support

If this app helps with your DeepCool Digital display, you can support or follow

## Download

Get the latest release from GitHub Releases.

Choose the package for your system:

| System | Recommended download |
| --- | --- |
| Arch Linux | `.pkg.tar.zst` |
| Windows | `.exe` installer or `.zip` |

## Install

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -U deepcool-desktop-*.pkg.tar.zst
```

### Windows

Download and run `DeepCoolDigitalDartSetup-*-windows-x64.exe`.

## First Use

1. Open **DeepCool Digital Dart**.
2. Pick **CPU**, **GPU**, or **PSU** from the left side.
3. Click **Save ... view to display**.
4. Turn on **Keep display running** at the top of the app.
5. Approve the admin prompt if it appears.
6. If the app installs device access, unplug and reconnect the display once.

After that, the saved display mode should keep running after you close the app
and after you sign in again.

## How It Works

The GUI is only for choosing the display mode.

The **Keep display running** toggle starts a small background daemon that keeps
sending updates to the display. That is why the screen can keep working without
the app window being open.

PSU readings are shown when Linux exposes a real PSU sensor through hwmon. If
no PSU sensor is available, the PSU page and supported PSU display modes fall
back to an estimated **CPU + GPU power** value when those sensors are readable.
That estimate excludes motherboard, drives, fans, and PSU conversion losses.

## Troubleshooting

### The display stops when I close the app

Turn on **Keep display running**. If you are running from source instead of an
installed package, build the daemon first:

```bash
dart compile exe bin/deepcool_digital_dart.dart -o build/deepcool-digital-dart
```

### Linux is blocking access to the display

Turn on **Keep display running** and approve the admin prompt. Then unplug and
reconnect the display once.

Manual fallback:

```bash
sudo cp packaging/udev/99-deepcool-digital.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

### The display flickers between modes

This usually means an old system service is still running and sending a second
mode to the display. You do not need to clean the project. Turn **Keep display
running** off and on once, or run:

```bash
systemctl --user stop deepcool-digital-dart.service
sudo systemctl disable --now deepcool-digital-dart.service
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/deepcool-digital-dart.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### The app says HIDAPI is missing

Install HIDAPI for your distro:

```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S hidapi

# Fedora
sudo dnf install hidapi
```

On Windows, put `hidapi.dll` next to `deepcool_desktop_app.exe` and
`deepcool-digital-dart.exe`, or put it in a directory listed in `PATH`.

### Windows sensors show N/A

Windows does not expose CPU/GPU/PSU hardware sensors through a Linux-style
`hwmon` interface. Windows release builds include `deepcool-sensor-backend.exe`,
a headless local backend built on LibreHardwareMonitorLib. It has no taskbar
window or tray icon; the installer registers it as an elevated scheduled task so
the app can read CPU/GPU/PSU sensors without repeated admin prompts.

If you are running from source or using an incomplete package, make sure the
backend executable and LibreHardwareMonitorLib DLLs are next to the Flutter app
executable.

PSU telemetry still depends on the PSU hardware. If the PSU does not expose its
own sensors, the app estimates PSU power from readable CPU + GPU power.

## Development

Run the app from source:

```bash
cd flutter_desktop
flutter pub get
flutter run -d linux
```

On Windows:

```powershell
cd flutter_desktop
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```

Build release binaries:

```bash
cd flutter_desktop
flutter build linux --release
cd ..
dart compile exe bin/deepcool_digital_dart.dart -o build/deepcool-digital-dart
```

On Windows:

```powershell
cd flutter_desktop
flutter build windows --release
cd ..
dart compile exe bin/deepcool_digital_dart.dart -o build/deepcool-digital-dart.exe
```

For a complete Windows release zip, run:

```powershell
.\packaging\windows\build-release.ps1
```

The Windows app expects the daemon executable, `deepcool-sensor-backend.exe`,
and `hidapi.dll` to be available next to the app executable or in `PATH`. The
**Keep display running** toggle uses a hidden launcher in the current user's
Startup folder on Windows.

Useful checks:

```bash
dart format .
dart analyze lib bin
flutter analyze
flutter test
```
